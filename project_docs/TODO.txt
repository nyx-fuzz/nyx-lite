PRE RELEASE:
* documentation
  * a minimal fuzzing example
  * cleaning up lint errors
  * comments on the actual api

* proper memory api (p1)
  * Process Memory Abstraction
  * Api that returns shared pages to process memory
  * Allow to not reset shared pages
  * Add testing
  * make a generic Reader/Writer implementation for virtual memory
Debug APIs:
  * Simulating EPT based memory breakpoints by host mprotect (can crash when device emulation accesses this memory, slow on vmexits)
  * Inject Mapping / Inject Code
  * Explore DS /BTS Branch Trace Storage via MSR_IA32_DEBUGCTLMSR
Better Memory management
  * Use userfault_fd / signals to allow to have both EPT based breakpoints & shared root snapshots
  * Reduce unnecessary memory by making root snapshot shared between VMs 
Incremental snapshots  (p1)
  * snapshot tree api
Loading VMs
  * fix add api to load dockerfiles directly
  * investigate mke2fs to turn docker image into fs image
  * fix api to load a rootdir based fs directly, rather than going through
    docker first

bugfixes:
* fix BTF Branch Based single step via MSR_IA32_DEBUGCTLMSR
* fix kvm dirty ring api to speed up snapshots
* fix host atomic bitmap to speed up snapshots
* fix nested virtualization
* fix console output by redirect serial into a ptty
* ensure snapshot reset fixes VM shutdown
* make it so that changing IP resets vm.continuation state as appropriate
* make regs() and sregs() not read the register for every call
* speed up breakpoints by not enabling/disabling them ALL the time.
